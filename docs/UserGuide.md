ResidenceTracker (RT) is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, RT can get your residence management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all residences in the app.

   * **`add`**`n/Clementi HDB a/459A Clementi Ave 3, #04-257, S121459 clean/n book/y` : Adds a residence named `Clementi HDB` to the ResidenceTracker.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all residences.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Amber Heights`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Amber Heights t/friend` or as `n/Amber Heights`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME a/ADDRESS`, `a/ADDRESS n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `a/Jurong West St 60 a/Jurong West St 70`, only `a/Jurong West St 70` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
